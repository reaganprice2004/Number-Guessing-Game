# 🎲 Number-Guessing-Game (Python)
**Timeline:** Originally created September 2023
Welcome to my first Python mini-project --- a classic **Number Guessing Game**, built entirely in the terminal using Python!
The computer picks a random number between 1 and 100. Your job? Guess it - as fast as you can. It gives you hints, counts your attempts, and celebrates when you win. 🔥

## 🚀 Features
- Random number generation using Python's built-in 'random' module
- Input validation to keep things clean
- Dynamic feedback on each guess (too high, too low)
- Keeps track of how many guesses it took you
- Easily expandable into a GUI or web app

## 🧪 How to Run It Locally
1. Clone this repo

'''bash
git clone https://github.com/reaganprice2004/number-guessing-game.git
cd number-guessing-game
2. Run the script with Python
python guessing_game.py
3. Start guessing!

## 💡 Future Ideas
- Add a scoreboard
- Allow players to pick a difficulty level
- Store best scores in a .json or database
- Track user stats over time
